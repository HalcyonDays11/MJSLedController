# MJSLedController
This is just a simple Java port of the control code for the MJS Gadgets USB LED controller (https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Interface-Mjs-usb-led-2-Newest-Version/dp/B00TR6I2XK).  Why?  Because I needed something more cross platform than what the code was originally written in (C#).  I am in no way affiliated with MJS Gadgets, so don't consider this an official Java version of what the controller ships with, but it works well enough for me.
## Dependencies
This project is highly dependent on the purejavahid project (https://github.com/nyholku/purejavahidapi), which in turn depends on JNA.
## License
This project is licensed under the WTFPL (so go nuts).  At the time this poorly maintained README was created, purejavahid was BSD licensed as well, and JNA is dual licensed under LGPL/ASL.  As long as you don't try to hold me responsible for the code if something goes wrong, do whatever you want.
